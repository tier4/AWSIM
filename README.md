# Smartpole-VR-AWSIM

This is a fork of [tier4/AWSIM](https://tier4.github.io/AWSIM/GettingStarted/QuickStartDemo/) adapted to support **VR-based simulations of Smartpole Interaction Units (SPIUs)**.  
The goal is to simulate infrastructure-to-human interaction experiences and evaluate **perceived safety, clarity, and timing of eHMIs** (external Human-Machine Interfaces) provided by SPIUs in urban environments.

> [!NOTE]  
> Check out the [v2.0.0 announcement](https://github.com/tier4/AWSIM/issues/383) for major AWSIM updates!

## 🔍 Purpose

This project extends AWSIM to enable:
- **Immersive first-person VR experiences** of smartpole-based external HMI signals.
- **Human-in-the-loop evaluations** for safety perception and usability testing.
- **Scenario experimentation** using ROS 2-based simulation, Autoware compatibility, and Unity rendering.

Ideal for researchers and developers working on:
- Infrastructure-based eHMI interactions with pedestrians using VR
- Collective perception with different road participants
- Smart city and V2X deployment studies
- Safety evaluation of infrastructure HMI systems

---

## 🌟 Features

- Forked and compatible with the latest [Autoware](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware)
- Fully integrated with ROS 2 communication
- Unity-based 3D simulation with VR support
- Scenarios involving **smartpole interactions**, traffic lights, and vulnerable road users
- Runs on Ubuntu 22.04 and Windows 10/11

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Start with the base AWSIM tutorial:

👉 [Quick Start Demo](https://tier4.github.io/AWSIM/GettingStarted/QuickStartDemo/)

Then, check out the SPIU-specific VR simulation guide (coming soon).
