# Add custom ROS2 message type

## ROS2 For Unity

AWSIM uses [Ros2ForUnity](https://github.com/RobotecAI/ros2-for-unity) module for ROS2 communication. `ROS2 For Unity` is a high-performance communication solution to connect Unity3D and ROS2 ecosystem in a ROS2 "native" way.

This document briefly guides you on how to add your custom messages to the simulation. For a detailed description, please see [ROS2 For Unity Readme](https://github.com/RobotecAI/ros2-for-unity/blob/master/README.md).

## Prerequisites

`ROS2 For Unity` depends on a [ros2cs](https://github.com/RobotecAI/ros2cs) - a C# .NET library for ROS2. You don't have to install it manually, but there are a few prerequisites that must be resolved first.

Please refer to the following prerequisites section for your OS:

=== "Ubuntu"
    [Ubuntu prerequisites](https://github.com/RobotecAI/ros2cs/blob/master/README-UBUNTU.md#prerequisites)

=== "Windows"
    [Windows prerequisites](https://github.com/RobotecAI/ros2cs/blob/1.2.0/README-WINDOWS.md#prerequisites)

Additionall required tools:

- Git
- Shell:

    === "Ubuntu"
        `bash`

    === "Windows 10"
        `powershell`

## Build custom messages

### Assumptions

To include a custom ROS2 message, you have to build `ROS2 For Unity` with your custom message package. The following steps will assume that:

- the temporary `ROS2 For Unity` build folder is located in the home directory

    === "Ubuntu"
        `~/`

    === "Windows"
        `C:\`

- your message package is called `custom_msgs` and is located under the path:

    === "Ubuntu"
        `~/custom_msgs`

    === "Windows"
        `C:\custom_msgs`
- ROS2 version is `humble` (`foxy` and `galactic` are also supported, please check the current AWSIM version for more information about its ROS2 version) and is located in

    === "Ubuntu"
        `/opt/ros/humble`

    === "Windows"
        `C:\ros2_humble`

### Workspace preparation

1. Clone `ROS2 For Unity` repository.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/RobotecAI/ros2-for-unity
    ```

1. Pull dependent repositories

    === "Ubuntu"
        ```bash
        cd ~/ros2-for-unity
        . /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
        ./pull_repositories.sh
        ```

    === "Windows"
        ```powershell
        cd C:\ros2-for-unity
        C:\ros2_humble\local_setup.ps1
        .\pull_repositories.ps1
        ```

### Setup `custom_msgs` package

#### Package hosted on git repository

1. Open `ros2-for-unity/ros2_for_unity_custom_messages.repos` file in your favorite editor,
2. Modify the file contents, so it points to `custom_msgs` repository by changing `<REPOSITORY_URL>` to repository address, `<BRANCH_NAME>` to desired branch and `<PACKAGE_NAME>` to your local package name representation - in this case `custom_msgs`. The configured file should look as follows:

    ```
    # NOTE: Use this file if you want to build with custom messages that reside in a separate remote repo.
    # NOTE: use the following format

    repositories:
        src/ros2cs/custom_messages/<PACKAGE_NAME>:
            type: git
            url: <REPOSITORY_URL>
            version: <BRANCH_NAME>
    ```
3. Now please, pull repositories to download and setup the package:
    
    === "Ubuntu"
        ```bash
        ./pull_repositories.sh
        ```

    === "Windows"
        ```powershell
        .\pull_repositories.ps1
        ```

#### Package contained on local machine

1. Simply `custom_msgs` package to `src/ros2cs/custom_messages` directory
    
    === "Ubuntu"
        ```bash
        cp -r ~/custom_msgs ~/ros2-for-unity/src/ros2cs/custom_messages/
        ```

    === "Windows"
        ```bash
        cp -r ~/custom_msgs ~/ros2-for-unity/src/ros2cs/custom_messages/
        ```

### Build ROS2 For Unity

Build `ROS2 For Unity` using the foolowing command:

=== "Ubuntu"
    ```
    ./build.sh --standalone
    ```

=== "Windows"
    ```
    .\build.ps1 -standalone
    ```

### Install `custom_msgs` to AWSIM

New `ROS2 For Unity` build, which you just made, contains multiple libraries that already exist in the AWSIM. To install `custom_msgs` and not copy all other unnecessary files, you should get the `custom_msgs` related libraries only and copy them to the analogous directories in `AWSIM/Assets/Ros2ForUnity`.

You can find them in following directories:

- `ros2-for-unity/install/asset/Ros2ForUnity/Plugins` which names matches `custom_msgs_*`

=== "Ubuntu"
    ```
    `ros2-for-unity/install/asset/Ros2ForUnity/Plugins/Linux/x86_64/` which names matches `libcustom_msgs_*`
    ```

=== "Windows"
    ```
    `ros2-for-unity/install/asset/Ros2ForUnity/Plugins/Windows/x86_64/` which names matches `custom_msgs_*`
    ```

To automate the process, you can use these commands (change `<AWSIM_DIR>` to your E2Simulator path and `<CUSTOM_MSGS_PACKAGE_NAME>` to a custom messages package):

=== "Ubuntu"
    ```
    find ~/ros2-for-unity/install/asset/Ros2ForUnity/Plugins -maxdepth 1 -name "<CUSTOM_MSGS_PACKAGE_NAME>*"    -type f -exec cp {} <AWSIM_DIR>/Assets/Ros2ForUnity/Plugins \;
    find ~/ros2-for-unity/install/asset/Ros2ForUnity/Plugins/Linux/x86_64 -maxdepth 1 -name     "lib<CUSTOM_MSGS_PACKAGE_NAME>*" -type f -exec cp {} <AWSIM_DIR>/Assets/Ros2ForUnity/Plugins/Linux/x86_64 \;
    ```

=== "Windows"
    ```
    Get-ChildItem C:\ros2-for-unity\install\asset\Ros2ForUnity\Plugins\* -Include @('<CUSTOM_MSGS_PACKAGE_NAME>*') | Copy-Item -Destination <AWSIM_DIR>\Assets\Ros2ForUnity\Plugins
    Get-ChildItem C:\ros2-for-unity\install\asset\Ros2ForUnity\Plugins\Windows\x86_64\* -Include @('<CUSTOM_MSGS_PACKAGE_NAME>*') | Copy-Item -Destination <AWSIM_DIR>\Assets\Ros2ForUnity\Plugins\Windows\x86_64
    ```
