# How to Contribute

Everyone is welcome!

## How can I get help?
Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for confirmed bug reports. 
Instead, open a discussion in the [Q&A category](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/discussions/new?category=q-a).
The trouble shooting page at [AWSIM](../TroubleShooting/index.md) and at [Autoware](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/support/troubleshooting/) will be also helpful.

## Issue
Before you post an issue, please search [Issues](https://github.com/tier4/AWSIM/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and [Discussions Q&A catecory](https://github.com/orgs/autowarefoundation/discussions/categories/q-a) to check if it is not a known issue.

[This page](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-repository) is helpful how to create an issue from a repository.

## Pull requests
If you have an idea to improve the simulation, you can submit a pull request.
The following process should be followed:

1. Create a derived branch (`feature/***`) from the `main` branch.
2. Create a pull request to the `main` branch.

Please keep the following in mind, while developing new features:
