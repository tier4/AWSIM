### Overview
`Traffic Simulation` consists of the following components:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| TrafficSimulator | Collecting all traffic simulators and managing the spawning and simulating process. |
| NpcVehicleSpawner | Get Npc vehicle states and updating simulation steps. |
| NpcVehicleSimulator | Spawning random Npc vehicle in spawning lanes. |
| RandomTrafficSimulator | Managing lifecycle of NPCs and simulating NPC behaviours. |
| TrafficLane<br>TrafficLight<br>TrafficIntersection<br>StopLine | Traffic entities. |
| NpcVehicle | Vehicle models (NPCs) controlled by `RandomTrafficSimulator`. |

### Configuration
`Traffic Simulation` can be configured from `TrafficSimulator` component.

The configurable elements are listed in the following table:

#### General Settings

<popup-img src="./config0.png" alt="Configulations0"></popup-img>

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Ego Vehicle | Ego vehicle handler. If not set, the manager creates a dummy ego.<br>This reference is also set automatically when the Ego spawns via the traffic simulator. |
| Seed | Seed value for random generator. |
| Traffic Intersections | The field that is set `TrafficIntersection` objects.<br>`TrafficIntersection` to be set is controlled by `Traffic Simulation`. |

#### NPC Vehicle Settings

<popup-img src="./config1.png" alt="Configulations1"></popup-img>

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Vehicle Config | Parameters for NPC vehicle control.<br/>`Sudden Deceleration` is a deceleration related to emergency braking. |
| Obstacle Layer Mask | The obstacle layer for raytracing the collision distances. |
| Ground Layer Mask | The Ground layer for raytracing the collision distances. |
| Max Vehicle Count | The maximum number of vehicles that can simultaneously live in the scene.<br>Lowering this value results in less dense traffic but improves the simulator's performance. |

## Instruction
To use `Traffic Simulation`, please follow the steps below.

For the preparation, the following must be prepared:

- 3D map (.fbx)
- lanelet map (.osm)

!!! info
    AWSIM includes `AutowareSimulationDemo` scene.<br>
    Please refer to:<br>
    * `Assets/Awsim/Scenes/AutowareSimulationDemo.unity`

### 1. Place Traffic Simulator
Please create `TrafficSimulator` component as the following:

1. Create empty `GameObject` (should be named `TrafficSimulator`).<br>
2. Attach this object to `TrafficSimulator` component.
3. (optional) To place objects which is generated later, you may create empty objects named `TrafficIntersections` and `NPCPedestrians`.

<popup-img src="./hierarchy.png" alt="Place Traffic Simulator"></popup-img>

### 2. TrafficIntersection and LaneletTrafficLight settings
Please place intersection objects and attach `LaneletTrafficLight` script.<br>
Then, please you set traffic lights to intersection.

<popup-img src="./traffic_intersection.png" alt="Traffic Intersection"></popup-img>

Please configure `TrafficIntersection` and `LaneletTrafficLight` components as the following:

1. Add a empty `GameObject` as a child object of `TrafficIntersections` hierarchy
    1. The `GameObject` should be named `TrafficIntersection.x`
    2. The `Transform` of `GameObject` should be set on the target intersection
2. Attach a `TrafficIntersection` component to the intersection game object
3. Attach `LaneletTrafficLight` to traffic light objects placed on the target intersection
<popup-img src="./traffic_light.png" alt="Traffic Light"></popup-img>
4. Modify `Bulb Material Config` as follow images<br>
vehicle traffic light<br>
<popup-img src="./bulb_vehicle.png" alt="Bulb Vehicle"></popup-img>
pedestrian traffic light<br>
<popup-img src="./bulb_pedestrian.png" alt="Bulb Pedestrian"></popup-img>
    1. If there are wrong order of bulb, modify each `Bulb Material Config`
5. Set traffic light objects attached `LaneletTrafficLight` in step. 3 to `TrafficLightGroups` in `TrafficIntersection`
    1. Traffic lights which should light same sequences should be set on same `TrafficLightGroups`

!!! warning
    Do not attach `LaneletTrafficLight` to traffic lights which are not set to `TrafficIntersection`.<br>
    It causes errors.

!!! info
    For detailed settings of `Bulb Material Config`, see [here](../../Entity/Infra/TrafficLight/index.md).

#### Modify `Lighting Sequences`
If you need to set an arbitrary signal control pattern, you can modify it in `Lighting Sequences` field.

Create any number of elements of `Lighting Sequences` and set parameters for each one.<br>
When the scene plays, the `Lighting Sequences` will execute sequentially from `Element 0`.<br>
In addition, when the last element completes, the sequence will loop back to `Element 0`.

<popup-img src="./lighting_sequences.png" alt="Lighting Sequences"></popup-img>

The `Waypoint settings` parameters are listed in the following table:

Lighting Sequences

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Interval Sec | Duration for which this sequence continues. |
| Group Lighting Orders | Settings for lighting each `TrafficLightGroups`. |

Group Lighting Orders

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Group | Target `TrafficLightGroups`. |
| Bulb Data | Setting for lighting each bulb in traffic lights within `TrafficLightGroups`. |

Bulb Data

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Type | Target bulb. |
| Color | Color of lighting on target bulb. |
| Status | Type of lighting. (Solid On, Solid Off and Flashing) |

#### Set right of ways on uncontrolled intersections
On intersections without traffic lights, it is needed to set the right of way of TrafficLane manually for the vehicles to operate properly.

Please configure `TrafficLane` components as the following:

1. Select a straight lane that should be right of way in the intersection
<popup-img src="./right_of_ways_before.png" alt="Right of Ways Before"></popup-img>
    1. The selected lane should be highlighted
2. Click the `Set RightOfWays` button to give the lane priority over other lanes
<popup-img src="./right_of_ways_after.png" alt="Right of Ways Before"></popup-img>

Please check if all lanes that intersect with the selected lane are highlighted yellow.<br>
This means that the right of way was applied correctly.

### 3. Load lanelet
`LaneletLoader` can load a lanelet map and create `TrafficLane` and `StopLine`.
In addition, `LaneletLoader` set parameter of traffic rules to `TrafficLane`, `StopLine` and traffic lights.<br>
`LaneletLoader` can be performed by opening `AWSIM -> Common -> Load Lanelet` at the toolbar of Unity Editor.

<popup-img src="./load_lanelet_tool_bar.png" alt="Tool Bar"></popup-img>

Please use `LaneletLoader` as the following:

1. Fill in `Osm` field with a lanelet map (`.osm`) you prepared, `Root Object` field with a `TrafficSimulator` object.<br>
2. Adjust `Waypoint settings` parameters for the loading process if needed.<br>
3. To load the lanelet map, please click `Load` button.

<popup-img src="./load_lanelet.png" alt="Load Lanelet"></popup-img>

The `Waypoint settings` parameters are listed in the following table:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Resolution | Resolution of resampling. Lower values provide better accuracy at the cost of processing time. |
| Min Delta Length | Minimum length(m) between adjacent points. |
| Min Delta Angle | Minimum angle(deg) between adjacent edges.<br>Lowering this value produces a smoother curve. |

`TrafficLane`, `StopLine` and `TrafficLight` will be generated and placed as child objects of the `Root Object`.<br>
You can check their visual representation by clicking consecutive elements in the scene hierarchy.
