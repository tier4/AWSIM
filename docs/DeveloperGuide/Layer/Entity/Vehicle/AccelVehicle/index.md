`AccelVehicle` is acceleration based vehicle. This vehicle model was created for Autoware simulation, and assuming that Autoware has already created a gas pedal map, this vehicle model uses acceleration as an input value. It has the following features:

- Longitudinal control by acceleration ($\frac{m}{s^2}$).
- Lateral control by two-wheel model.
- Yaw, roll and pitch controlled by [*Physics*](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PhysicsSection.html) engine.
- Mass-spring-damper suspension model ([`WheelColliders`](#wheels-colliders)).
- automatic gears change.
- 3D Mesh as road surface for vehicle driving, gradient resistance.

## Create custom vehicle

It is easier to understand if you refer to `Lexus RX450h 2015.prefab`.

1. Prepare a 3D model of the vehicle. (Separate the wheels, body and lights)
1. Set up `WheelCollider` for each wheel and `MeshCollider` or other collider for vehicle body.
1. Attach the `Rigidbody` component to the vehicle and configure inspector.
1. Attach the `AccelVehicle.cs` script to the vehicle and configure inspector.
1. Attach the `AccelVehicleVisualEffect.cs` script to the vehicle and configure inspector.
1. Attach the `AccelVehicleControlModeBasedInputter` script the vehicle and configure inspector.
1. Attach and configure any VehicleInput classes (`AccelVehicleKeyboardInput`, `AccelVehicleRos2Input`, `AccelVehicleLogitechG29Input`) that inherits from `IAccelVehicleInput`.
1. (optional) By attaching `AccelVehicleReportRos2Publisher` and `AccelVehicleControlModeSrvServer`, it is possible to connect to Autoware.


## Create custom input

1. Create a new class that inherits from `IAccelVehicleInput`.
1. Implement updates to the values of `IAccelVehicleInput` input values.
1. Reference the custom input class you created to `AccelVehicleControlModeBasedInputter` and use it in either autonomous mode or manual mode.
